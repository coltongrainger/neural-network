When I interviewed Dr. Lewis last week and asked for a student interview
suggestion, he didn't hesitate at all when he enthusiastically asked, "Has
anybody recommended Layne Hubbard yet?" I understood Dr. Lewis's enthusiasm
when I got to sit down with Layne last week. Layne is an influential, kind,
motivated, and hardworking student whose passion clearly touches all those with
whom she interacts. Layne is a third year PhD student in our department
designing human-agent collaboration. Chatting with and learning about Layne was
inspiring and motivating. I can't adequately emphasize that everyone should
know her.

What is your path in getting to CU Boulder?
-------------------------------------------

Layne taught preschool for four years prior to attending CU and noticed
that the children she taught were all going through some form of
transition or trauma, whether it be losing family member or learning
English. Layne began thinking about ways in which our cultural habits
could adopt supportive patterns that would enable children to retain
their strength of self through these difficult times, and ensure that
their passion and confidence come through on other side. These ideas
inspired Layne to attend CU for her undergraduate education where she
did research in the neuroscience, cognitive science, and computer
science departments creating computational models of the mind. Upon
graduation from the computer science department, it was a seamless
transition to continue her graduate studies here.

Can you pinpoint one person who has been instrumental in your academic decisions?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As an undergraduate Layne volunteered to help Dr. Lewis develop the BA
Thesis program. During their work together Dr. Lewis asked Layne what
she was passionate about. Upon hearing her goals he suggested that Layne
apply to PhD programs and helped her view graduate study in a different
way than she had previously. Earning one's PhD does not imply the life
of the professor---there are many opportunities beyond graduate school.
Layne chooses to view her graduate studies as an opportunity to develop
and prepare the world for new ideas. 

If you could make sure everybody in the world knew one thing, what would that one thing be?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Love is protective and a resilient and transformative force. We have
trouble comprehending that kind of power, but should allow ourselves to
connect with its depth and complexity.

What are some of your hobbies?
------------------------------

Layne loves to peacefully observe and identify nature, and finds joy in
learning how to read clouds, understand animal tracks, and identify
trees. Layne commented on the peace and clarity that comes from
immersing oneself in nature. She also loves to swim, draw, and spend
time connecting with and learning from kids.

What are some improbable facts about you?
-----------------------------------------

Layne switched schools twelve times in Kindergarten through 12th grade.
One of the appealing aspects of the time commitment of a PhD is that
Layne gets to settle down for a bit, leave the world of sprints and
develop long-term thinking skills. Layne has toured US and Canada three
times on music tours, two of which playing her own music. Recently she
learned that one of her ancestors also toured the US and Mexico playing
their original gospel songs.

What part of what you do makes you most excited?
------------------------------------------------

Layne loves it when she shares her research project with someone and her
excitement is reciprocated. Oftentimes people respond with personal
anecdotes about how her project could personally impact them. Layne also
loves when kids contribute their own imagination and energy to her
ideas---it validates and inspires the importance of her work.

Icebreaker Suggestions:
