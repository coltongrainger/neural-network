FULL DISCLAIMER: When I asked to interview Vanessa for this week's issue of The
Neural Network, I had no idea how amazing she was. After getting to chat with
her for over an hour, I became enamored with how Vanessa views and interacts
with our world. If this issue of the NN seems particularly gushy and
complimentary, I encourage you to go chat with Vanessa to find out why I think
she's so wonderful.

What is your path in getting to CU Boulder?
-------------------------------------------

Vanessa was born into a huge family in Orange County, CA, but later
moved to Utah with her parents. Upon recognizing that she was unhappy in
Utah, she dropped everything, moved away from everything she knew, and
came to Colorado. After bouncing around, Vanessa started working in the
counseling office at CU. When a position opened up in the CS department,
Vanessa jumped at the opportunity to see the academic aspects of CU (the
day I spoke to Vanessa was the 1 year anniversary of when she started
working in CS!). Her enthusiasm for her job is inspiring and contagious,
and she eagerly told me how rewarding her job is. Vanessa loves helping
people, and loves the challenge of determining the best way to help
every person who walks through her door.

What are your hobbies?
----------------------

At one point in our conversation Vanessa casually mentioned that people
always like asking her what she did over the weekend, because it was
always interesting. This intrigued me, and upon asking I was surprised
to hear that Vanessa had: volunteered at a cider and bluegrass festival,
done archery and axe throwing, won a tricycle race, and was going to a
kickboxing lesson that night. Vanessa is intentional and reflective
about all facets of her life, and applies this attitude of "getting it
done" to everything from the request to make 500 copies of an exam, to
learning how to shoot a bow and arrow.

If you could make sure everybody in the world knew one thing, what would that one thing be?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is so important to understand that we are all fighting in our own
ways. Vanessa is passionate about the importance of understanding our
privileges and how they impact our differing perspectives. We all come
from different backgrounds with different motivations, and learning to
reconcile these differing perspectives will start the conversations
necessary to solve a lot of the problems in the world today.

What are some improbable facts about you?
-----------------------------------------

Vanessa can back squat and deadlift 110 pounds. She is 3/4 hispanic, but
has had ancestors living in the US since 1704. She is also a self
proclaimed nerd, the 1994 Pog state champion, an Xbox gamer, a Dungeon
Master, and a board game fanatic.

What advice can you share with us?
----------------------------------

"It costs next to nothing to be nice to someone, to brighten their
day---it might mean the world to them." Even when Vanessa is sad, or
tired, or overwhelmed, she still takes time to recognize that even
though that is how she is feeling, everyone else is also fighting their
own battles. It's important for us to choose to help one another through
these battles, to devote quality time and attention to those around us,
and make that extra effort to try to brighten someone's day.

Icebreaker Suggestions:
-----------------------

"What's the thing you've always wanted to do but no one wants to go
with you?" Vanessa can help you fix that. "I'm slowly transitioning into
Wonder Woman, I think." This was one of my favorite quotes from our
conversation, and it is so true. Vanessa goes above and beyond to help
our community. Next time you see her, make sure to thank Vanessa for all
that she does.
