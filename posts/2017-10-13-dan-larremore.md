This week I had the distinct pleasure of sitting down with Dr. Dan
Larremore. Dan is passionate about cultivating a community within our
department, excited about activism, and enthusiastic about his research,
among many other things. What is written below does not capture the
whole story. If you see Dan around campus, "nerd snipe" him to start a
connection!

What is your path in getting to CU Boulder?
-------------------------------------------

As an undergraduate, Dan didn't know that his professors were not only
teachers, but also researchers. After graduating, Dan worked in industry
and began applying to law school, only withdrawing his applications when
a family friend reminded him that going to law school meant becoming a
lawyer. The family friend set him up with his son, an applied
mathematics PhD candidate. The conversation inspired Dan to apply to the
CU Boulder MS program, which turned into a PhD when Dan learned what it
meant to be a researcher. After graduation, upon the encouragement of
Aaron Clauset, Dan became a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Public
Health, and then an Omidyar fellow at the Santa Fe Institute before
joining the Department of Computer Science and the BioFrontiers
Institute this August.

What are your hobbies?
----------------------

Dan has recently adopted an appreciation for running, enjoys cycling,
and is learning how to play the game Go. Some of his favorite authors
are Denis Johnson, Joan Didion, and John Steinbeck. Dan is also hoping
to join a volleyball team and start a band.

What advice can you share with us?
----------------------------------

If you don't feel like you're on "the" track, it's okay. There are many
paths in academia, do not feel discouraged if yours is different. Keep
your eyes open for opportunities, and be ready to jump on them when they
come up. It's also okay to change course: it's important to make a
sustained effort in an area, but it's also important to know whento
walk away if it's not good for you.Science is done by humans, and is
therefore social. When we write papers, we are communicating with other
people. This means that we should invest time in being a human.
Acknowledge that we are not paper producing automata by organizing a
happy hour with the lab next door, having fun, and joking around. When
we are better humans, it makes the department and institution better.

What are three improbable facts about you?
------------------------------------------

Dan taught math at a New Mexico State Penitentiary for two years to men
that were confined to their cell for twenty hours a day. This experience
has lead him to develop very strong opinions about criminal justice
reform.

After breaking his leg during a ski race, Dan didn't walk for six
months. During this time, Dan experienced the help and love of friends,
acquaintances, and strangers. It changed his perspective on how people
support and care for one another in times of need.

There are certain things that Dan takes seriously, and certain things
that he doesn't take seriously at all. He believes in a healthy amount
of irreverence, and one of his outlets of this irreverence is through
his official ID photos. Ask to see his driver's licenses to see a
mustachioed and stoic Dan.

Icebreaker suggestions:
-----------------------

Looking for an excuse to start a conversation with Dan? Try "nerd
sniping" him (to understand this phrase, google "XKCD Nerd Snipe").

Next week The Neural Network will spotlight a student that I've asked
Dan to suggest. Stay tuned!
