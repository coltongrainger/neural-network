Last week I asked Dan Larremore to recommend a student to spotlight in the
first student issue of The Neural Network. Dan recommended Amjad Alharbi, a
senior in computer science. Amjad is also a research assistant in the
information science department, conducting data analysis on how people use
social media.

What is your path in getting to CU Boulder?
--------------------------------------------

When Amjad was in middle school, she would never never guessed that she
would end up studying computer science. Amjad grew up in Saudi Arabia,
where her main interest was political science. She explained that at
home if someone is socially active or a human rights activist, they put
themselves and their family at risk of getting in trouble. This
discouraged Amjad from pursuing political science. In spring 2011,
however, she saw the power of social media in organizing protests within
her community. This use of social media made Amjad recognize that even
if she didn't feel comfortable pursuing political science, she could
still develop these passions and initiate social change through computer
science. Amjad's older brother was doing his PhD in computer science at
Boulder and helped her grow what is now an unquenchable desire to learn
more about computer, data, and information science.

What are your hobbies?
----------------------

Amjad truly does love what she does, and explained to me that
oftentimes she spends her weekends learning new concepts and frameworks
of data science. On top of her regular studies, Amjad is teaching
herself how to speak and write Japanese!

What part of what you do makes you most excited?
------------------------------------------------

What amazes Amjad about data science is the opportunity to work with
interdisciplinary data sets. She loves being able to learn about other
fields while doing data analysis. Amjad also likes that in data science
you\'re not typically working with other people with CS backgrounds.
Instead, your collaborators have tools and skills specific to their
profession, but not those necessary to investigate the data. Amjad loves
helping people discover these patterns that they wouldn't be able to see
otherwise.

Who is one person that has been instrumental in your life?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Amjad's brother has been a huge influence in both her personal and
academic choices. When she first started considering a career in
computer science she was uncertain. Her brother talked with her about
it, helped her learn different programming languages, and pointed her to
resources that would help inspire and support her. Whenever either of
them learns about something interesting in CS, they send it to each
other. When their family gets together, Amjad and her brother always get
into discussions about CS, something that annoys the rest of the family
but inspires Amjad. Amjad was grateful that her brother helped her
discover her passion.

Do you have any advice for other students?
-------------------------------------------

Amjad reflected upon the external pressures on students to learn skills
to make themselves more competitive on the job market. She recalled the
difficulty in devoting time and energy to learning with this motivation.
She suggested that students find their passions first, and from there
learn the necessary skills to develop and pursue their passions. If the
reader will excuse my paraphrased generalization, Amjad's wisdom applies
to people in all stages of life. Pursue your passions, and don't let the
world tell you how to live.

Icebreaker Suggestion
---------------------

Have any good CS podcast suggestions? Amjad listens to Super Data
Science, Data Sidekick, and Talking Machines and is open to
recommendations!
