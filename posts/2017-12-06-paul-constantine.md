Dr. Paul Constantine is an assistant professor and one of 19 new faculty in our
growing department. Paul's background is in computational mathematics and his
research is in developing and analyzing methods that seek to identify
exploitable low dimensional structures in complex computational science models.
Paul is also my advisor, the best professor I've ever had, my strongest
advocate, and one of my biggest role models. The words below are incapable of
capturing Paul's contagious enthusiasm and energy--- we are beyond lucky to
have his influence in our department. "In mathematics you don't understand
things, you just get used to them." -- John von Neumann

What is your path in getting to CU Boulder?
--------------------------------------------

It's easy to create indestructible giants of our professors and mentors,
to revere them as scientific prodigies who have always had their paths
carved out. As a student this can be discouraging when we encounter
doubts or struggles. Paul's story helps shatter this unhealthy mirage.
Paul had a spotty undergraduate career and dropped out to pursue his
passions as a musician and travel Europe. Eventually he graduated with a
BA in mathematics and a minor in music from the University of North
Texas, and went on to work as an actuarial analyst and software
developer. Paul then received his MS and PhD from the Institute of
Computational and Mathematical Engineering at Stanford, worked as the
John von Neumann fellow at Sandia National Labs, and was a postdoc at
Stanford. Most recently Paul was an assistant professor in the
Department of Applied Mathematics at the Colorado School of Mines, where
he left (with me, his two PhD students, and his postdoc!) to join the
wonderful department here.

What are some of your hobbies?
------------------------------

Paul loves music, plays the drums, percussion, and electronics, and is
looking to join or start a band! Paul also loves embarrassing himself at
karaoke, playing soccer, ping pong, and traveling. 

What are some improbable facts about you?
-----------------------------------------

Paul's grad school band played with the musician K.Flay, who just got
nominated for two Grammys. He went to high school with Jessica Simpson
and his mom is a Lutheran minister. He also didn't finish his first
calculus class until the summer after his freshman year of college.

If you could make sure everybody in the world knew one thing, what would that one thing be?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Imagine the world if everybody knew how to think about problems like
optimization problems, with objective functions and constraints.
Everything from policy decisions to personal arguments would be more
intentional and clear. 

What part of what you do makes you most excited?
-------------------------------------------------

Paul is excited by finding low dimensional structures and developing
methods for finding them. Equally satisfying is being able to interpret
these structures in context of the problem, and his research allows him
to work on problems across disciplinary lines. "Interdisciplinary
communication is a euphemism for talking to people." Paul loves working
with people with different sets of interests and problems. He is excited
to understand and help solve these problems with mathematics,
statistics, and computation to make an impact.

What advice can you share with us?
-----------------------------------

Sympathize with those evaluating you: Everyone is going to be evaluated
throughout their careers, whether it be for a fellowship, grant, paper,
job application, or tenure. Understand what those evaluating you are
looking for, what their constraints and objective functions are, and
empathize with them. Practice epistemic humility: Be humble about the
degree to which one can really know things. Remember this in all
discussions and interactions and understand that you might be wrong.

Not all knowledge is scientific knowledge: There are things in the world
that cannot be quantified. We sell technical degrees as teaching people
how to problem solve. This is baloney, otherwise we'd see headlines
everyday about mathematicians solving world hunger or scientists ending
homelessness. Quantitative analysis is essential in solving in a
problem, but it is not all of it. We must learn from and understand
others' perspectives and knowledge.

Icebreaker Suggestions:
-------------------------

How many dimensions is high dimensions? "Also, I would love if someone
would send me a definition for artificial intelligence or machine
learning."
